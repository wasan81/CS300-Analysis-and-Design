# CS300-Analysis-and-Design

ABC University (ABCU) requires software that can help their computer science advisors in accessing course information for their students. The program should be able to import data from a file and store it in a tree data structure. It should also read the file, check for any errors, and display course information in a tree structure. The file containing all the courses required in the Computer Science curriculum at ABCU should have each line providing information about a single course, including its number, title, and prerequisites. As a final requirement, the program should generate a list of all Computer Science courses in alphabetical order. During the exercise, I faced a challenge while attempting to load a CSV file. This proved to be the most difficult part of the project, as it prevented me from testing my code. This project was very challenging for me because I had to write a program from scratch. However, starting early gave me enough time to make many changes and improve day by day. The pseudocode was extremely helpful to me as it acted as a guide for writing the code. Whenever I felt lost, I could refer back to the pseudocode.
